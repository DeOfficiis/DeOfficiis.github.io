## Welcome to De Officiis Github Pages.

These Github Pages are for private use only, and will be a compilation of summaries of language and application I study, as well as cheat sheets and usesful links.

Additionally, these pages serve as a "Hello World" to demonstrate competencies to whomever it concerns.


### Templates

The template for the is provided by Jekyll.  Whenever a commit is made to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in the Markdown files.


### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme, selected in the [repository settings](https://github.com/DeOfficiis/DeOfficiis.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.


### Markdown
